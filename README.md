I added a new function called borrowAuthNFT to the CryptoPoops contract I moved from the metacrafters site.
I then made it pubicly available by adding the CollectionPublic resource interface to CryptoPoops.
The collection and mint transactions were then created to create a new collection and mint an NFT respectively.
Finally, the idReader and nft scripts were created to obtain an NFT's ID and view its contents respectively.
